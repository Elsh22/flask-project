# Simplified Microscope GUI Flask Application

This is a simplified version of the microscope scanning GUI that works without SocketIO, making it compatible with Python 3.12.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Project Structure

First, make sure you have the following structure:
```
flask-project/
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application file
└── templates/              # Directory for HTML templates
    └── index.html          # Web interface template
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask matplotlib numpy
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Features

- Simple web interface with start/stop buttons
- Simulated microscope scanning with visualizations
- Real-time progress updates via polling

## Next Steps

To integrate with your real microscope hardware:

1. Replace the simulated data generation with actual calls to your hardware
2. Update the `run_scan()` function to use your actual hardware control code
3. Test thoroughly with real hardware

## Integration with Your Microscope Code

The current version uses simulated data. To integrate with your actual microscope code:

1. Import your hardware control functions
2. Replace the simulation code with your actual hardware control code
3. Make sure your hardware functions can be run in a thread safely

The key functions you'll need to modify are:
- `run_scan()` - Replace with your actual scanning logic
- `generate_simulated_spectrum()` - Replace with actual spectrum collection
